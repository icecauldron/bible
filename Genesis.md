1 In the beginning there was uncertainty. 2 And the universe had no form, and void; and we know not what was before deep time. And then, even in this uncertainty, there was pure energy and its children. 3 And in its birth, this energy produced immense heat, and light, and matter. 4 The energy whipped about wildly, without bounds or restriction, and it still does. 5 The energy could not be observed by the structures it built, it just was.  
6 In fathomable time, energy started touching other pieces of energy, and in this uncertainty, structure was built. 7 These structures evolved, grew, changed, and died away, on repeat. 8 This energy had no name, no direction, or hope.  
9 Uncertainty and the spaces it was birthing continued to expand and coalesce and it was good. 10 Subatomic particles formed elements and they joined together to create stability in the uncertainty. These elements built endless worlds -- built Earth.  12 And in this lineage of events, the Earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was the surviving kin of its kin. 13 The Sun, rain, mountains, trees, creatures, and processes of Earth all feed one another and are children of energy and uncertainty.  
14 The Earth rotated and continues to rotate with its sibling planets around the Sun with a certain pull and push. They move together and independantly unique with the sequence of structures given to them by the first uncertainty. 15 They cannot exist without one another. 16 The Sun drives the planets' weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate and there are billions of Suns like it. 17
