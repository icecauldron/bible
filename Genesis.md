1 In the beginning there was uncertainty. 2 And the universe had no form, and void; and we know not what was before deep time. And then, even in this uncertainty, there was pure energy and its children. 3 And in its birth, this energy produced immense heat, and light, and matter. 4 The energy whipped about wildly, without bounds or restriction, and it still does. 5 The energy could not be observed by the structures it built, it just was.  
6 In fathomable time, energy started touching other pieces of energy, and in this uncertainty, structure was built. 7 These structures evolved, grew, changed, and died away, on repeat. 8 This energy had no name, no direction, or hope.  
9 Uncertainty and the spaces it was birthing continued to expand and coalesce and it was good. 10 Subatomic particles formed elements and they joined together to create stability in the uncertainty. These elements built endless worlds -- built Earth.  12 And in this lineage of events, the Earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was the surviving kin of its kin. 13 The Sun, rain, mountains, trees, creatures, and processes of Earth all feed one another and are children of energy and uncertainty.  
14 The Earth rotated and continues to rotate with its sibling planets around the Sun with a certain pull and push. They move together and independantly unique with the sequence of structures given to them by the first uncertainty. 15 They cannot exist without one another. 16 The Sun drives the planets' weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate and there are billions of Suns like it.

20 Materials flow abundantly over the surface of the planets, and create uniquely designed worlds. Earth, is nourished by water and is teaming with life and prospect and change. 21 In time, which is ever flowing and ever changing, uncertainty created more uncertainty. This gave us whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl, after his kind: and it was good. 22 And as before, but in younger time, organisms started making copies, a likeness of themselves, for their existence was uncertain. 23 There are more cycles in these uncertain structures, each moment.  
24 Out of the water and light and earth, living creatures born of uncertainty breathed and mimicked and hungered and passed on. 25 Every beast and creeping thing was made of energy, and it was good. 26 Copies multiplied with uncertainty and knowledge of one another and energy and, in time, man evolved in this chain, and it was good. 26 Man was made in uncertainty's image, after everything that passed before its' likeness; and they have no more dominion over the world than the fish in the sea, or the fowl of the air, or the cattle on the Earth, or any creeping thing that hugs tightly to the ground. 27 Man's energy has always existed, even in deep time. 28 In the sinew of the universe, uncertainty was and is fruitful, and multiplicative, and replenishing, and wild: man, nor fish, nor fowl, or any living thing has dominion over uncertainty. 29 The energy is shared in every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, and in every rock. 30 Wherein there is life, there is energy, connection, and uncertainty. 31 Everything made, and beheld, and born is very good.
